Hi, I'm Sandeep Varthya 👋

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with ~3 years of experience specializing in the FinTech domain. I love translating complex business problems—particularly in credit risk, fraud detection, and GST analytics—into scalable, production-grade ML solutions.

My core expertise lies in the full ML lifecycle, from data wrangling and probabilistic modeling to end-to-end deployment and optimization. I'm passionate about building efficient, high-impact systems and thrive in collaborative, Agile environments.

🏦 Domain: Deep experience in FinTech, Credit Risk Modeling, and Micro-Lending.

🤖 Core Skills: Building production-ready ML systems and RAG-based AI applications.

🏅 Fun Fact: I was a Double Gold Medalist during my MBA in Business Analytics.

🧠 Skills & Tech Stack

My toolkit is built on Python and the modern AI/ML stack. I'm always learning, but here's what I work with most:

🚀 Featured Projects & Achievements

Here are a few highlights from my professional experience where I've made a tangible impact:

Underwriting Q&A Chatbot (RAG)

Developed and deployed a RAG-based chatbot using a Weaviate vector database, a fine-tuned OpenAI model, and a FastAPI backend.

Outcome: Enabled real-time, data-driven customer insights for underwriters.

High-Performance Credit Risk Model (GST DNA)

Engineered a high-performance credit risk model using MLflow that achieved a 12% improvement in GINI over the previous baseline.

Outcome: Succeeded by engineering novel features based on GST data (growth, turnover, stability, and circular trade activity).

ML Workflow Automation & Code Modernization

Automated complex validation workflows, dramatically reducing manual QA testing time from 4.5 man-days to just 3 hours.

Outcome: Modernized legacy codebases (PEP-8 standards, memory optimization), improving API response times by ~40%.

Predictive ML Model Deployment

Replaced initial rule-based systems with predictive ML models, significantly increasing portfolio lendability by 16%.

Outcome: Empowered underwriters with rapid, accurate creditworthiness insights via an integrated AI model.
